First things first get the sources as described in [https://code.google.com/p/crosspascal/source/browse/ this page]
{{{
    svn checkout http://crosspascal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ crosspascal
}}}

Then, navigate to `src/complier` and compile everything (this examples uses fpc, but you can use other Pascal compilers)
{{{
    fpc -B cpc.dpr
}}}

Finally compile files with
{{{
    ./cpc yourfile.pas
}}}
and profit!
